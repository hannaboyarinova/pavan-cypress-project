All assertions come from Chai library
Types of assertions:
    1. implicit (built-in or неявные in russian)
        - should()
        - and()
    2. explicit (явные in russian, assertions that we need to write explicitly)
        - expect() - is used in BDD approach
        - assert() - mainly used in TDD approach

Supported attributes for implicit assertions:
    - eq
    - contain
    - include
    - have.length
    - have.value
    - exist
    - the same attributes with not
    - etc
